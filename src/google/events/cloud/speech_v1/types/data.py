        improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if

        List items can also include pre-built or custom classes containing

        month of the year (e.g. "i was born in january", "i was born in
        febuary", ...), use the pre-built ``$MONTH`` class improves the
        likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months
        (e.g. "i was born in $month"). To refer to pre-built classes, use
        the class' symbol prepended with ``$`` e.g. ``$MONTH``. To refer to
        custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the
        class's ``custom_class_id`` to a string unique to all class
        resources and inline classes. Then use the class' id wrapped in
        $\ ``{...}`` e.g. "${my-months}". To refer to custom classes
        resources, use the class' id wrapped in ``${}`` (e.g.
        ``${my-months}``).

        Speech-to-Text supports three locations: ``global``, ``us`` (US
        North America), and ``eu`` (Europe). If you are calling the
        ``speech.googleapis.com`` endpoint, use the ``global`` location. To
        specify a region, use a `regional
        endpoint <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/endpoints>`__
        with matching ``us`` or ``eu`` location value.
