    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
    
    Foo foo = ...;
    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
    ...
    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
    }
    
    Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
    
    foo = Foo(...)
    any = Any()
    any.Pack(foo)
    ...
    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
    any.Unpack(foo)
    ...
    
    Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
    
    foo := &pb.Foo{...}
    any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
    ...
    foo := &pb.Foo{}
    if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
    ...
    }
    
    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
    name "y.z".
    
    
    JSON
    ====
    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:
    
    package google.profile;
    message Person {
    string first_name = 1;
    string last_name = 2;
    }
    
    {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
    "firstName": <string>,
    "lastName": <string>
    }
    
    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
    representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):
    
    {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
    "value": "1.212s"
    }
    """
    """A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
    the fully qualified name of the type (as in
    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
    
    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
    
    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
    value in binary format, or produce an error.
    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
    breaking changes.)
    
    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
    type.googleapis.com.
    
    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
    used with implementation specific semantics.
